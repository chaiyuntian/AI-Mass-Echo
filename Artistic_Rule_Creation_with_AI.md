# The Future of Artistic Creation with AI: Beyond Visual Outputs

The discussion emphasizes the potential transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the realm of artistic creation. Rather than focusing solely on the production of final visual artworks, the valuable application of AI lies in the creation and exploration of rules, enabling agents to generate and debug code based on dynamic rules or exploratory needs at runtime. This approach mirrors the essence of the artist's spirit, asserting that the core of art is not found in the mere diffusion of pixe...

Integrating thought processes into code generation aligns more closely with the fundamental pursuits of art. Future games and applications are expected to universally incorporate scripting systems that allow agents to write code and perform tasks, leveraging the vast community and sample size of existing scripting languages like Python and JavaScript. This paves the way for the translation of artists' procedural node workflows into code, enabling these artistic processes to be coded and subsequently learned.

The advent of technologies such as node transpilers, which can convert geometry nodes into Python code, exemplifies the potential for artists' node workflow processes to be transformed into a format that can be utilized for extensive learning by LLMs. This development heralds the possibility of creating stable and usable procedural coding agents as innovative tools for artists to use and experiment with, marking a significant shift in the landscape of artistic creation and application development.
